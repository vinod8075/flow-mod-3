# Authentication Smart Contract README

This repository contains a Move language smart contract for managing student profiles on the Flow blockchain, specifically designed for educational authentication.

## Smart Contract: Authentication

### Contract Overview:

The `Authentication` contract provides functionality for managing student profiles. It includes:

- Storage: A mapping `schoolProfile` to store student profiles based on their `UInt64` student IDs.
- Struct: `schoolProfiles` representing student details like `firstName`, `lastName`, `class`, `age`, and `studentId`.
- Functions:
  - `addProfile`: Adds a new student profile to the `schoolProfile` mapping.
  - `init`: Initializes the contract by creating an empty `schoolProfile` mapping.

### Smart Contract Usage:

Developers can deploy and interact with this contract to authenticate and manage student profiles on the Flow blockchain.

## Transaction Script: Add Profile

The `addProfile` transaction script allows the addition of a new student profile using the `Authentication` contract.

### Script Overview:

- Import the `Authentication` contract from its deployed address.
- Define a transaction with parameters: `firstName`, `lastName`, `class`, `age`, and `studentId`.
- Execute the `Authentication.addProfile` function with the provided parameters to add a new profile.
- Log a success message.

### Transaction Execution:

Developers can use this script to add a new student profile to the blockchain by calling the corresponding `addProfile` transaction.

## Script: Get Profile

The `main` script retrieves a student profile based on the provided `studentId`.

### Script Overview:

- Import the `Authentication` contract from its deployed address.
- Define the `main` function that takes a `studentId` as a parameter.
- Use the `Authentication.schoolProfile[studentId]!` expression to retrieve the associated student profile.
- Return the `schoolProfiles` struct.

### Script Execution:

Developers can utilize this script to query and retrieve student profiles from the blockchain based on the given `studentId`.
